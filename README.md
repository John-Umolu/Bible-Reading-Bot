# Bible Reading Bot
This project used the Speech To Text and Text To Speech libraries to access the bible dataset. It reads a passage of the bible when the user gives a speech command starting with the word READ. For example, "READ JOHN CHAPTER THREE VERSE FIVE" will read JOHN 3:5 of the bible passage.
